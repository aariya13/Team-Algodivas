## Domain and Idea
The project aims to provide users with a platform to compare biscuit and chocolate prices from different online stores. Given the challenges of gathering large-scale data, the website offers a simplified approach to comparing products by manually entering data from a few websites. Users can search for their favorite biscuits or chocolates, filter products based on their preferences, and add items to their wishlist. Additionally, the website strives to provide the best deals based on the product price comparison.

## Key Features
- **Brand and Product Selection:** Users can select a specific brand and explore various biscuit and chocolate products.
- **Price Comparison:** Displays prices from two different websites for each product, enabling users to choose the best deal.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for products by name.
- **Wishlist:** Users can add their favorite items to a wishlist for future reference.
- **Price Drop Alert (Experimental):** Attempted to implement an email alert system for price drops; however, restrictions on the college-provided laptop prevented the use of database-dependent applications.

  
## Technical Challenges
- Web scraping was not possible due to potential server blocks and the limitations of manual data entry.
- Unable to run XAMPP or any database applications due to restrictions on the college-provided laptop.
- Limited to comparing prices from two websites only due to the manual entry method.

## Future Improvements
- Enable dynamic data fetching through web scraping using proper techniques.
- Integrate a fully functional price drop alert system.
- Expand to include more categories and websites.
